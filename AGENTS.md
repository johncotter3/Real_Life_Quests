# AGENTS Instructions

This repository contains a React Native project.

## General Guidelines
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Always terminate JavaScript statements with semicolons.
- Prefer arrow functions and functional React components.
- Commit messages should be concise and written in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add login button").
- If any automated tests or lint commands are added in the future, run them before committing. Currently there are no test or lint scripts.

These instructions apply to the entire repository unless overridden by a nested `AGENTS.md`.
