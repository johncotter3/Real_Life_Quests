# AGENTS Instructions

This repository contains a React Native project.

## General Guidelines
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Always terminate JavaScript statements with semicolons.
- Prefer arrow functions and functional React components.
- Commit messages should be concise and written in the imperative mood (e.g. "Add login button").
- Run `npm test` before committing to ensure all Jest tests pass.
- There is currently no lint script.

These instructions apply to the entire repository unless overridden by a nested `AGENTS.md`.
