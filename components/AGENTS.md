# Components Guidelines

This directory contains reusable React Native components.

- Keep each component in its own file.
- Use prop types or TypeScript when adding new props.
- Keep styling close to the component using `StyleSheet.create`.
- Follow the repository's general coding conventions (2 spaces, semicolons).
